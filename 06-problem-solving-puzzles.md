# Chapter 6: Problem Solving & Puzzles (Computational Thinking)

## The Four Pillars of Computational Thinking

### 1. Decomposition: Breaking It Down
Take BIG problems and split them into SMALLER pieces.

**Big Problem:** Plan a birthday party
**Smaller Pieces:**
- Make guest list
- Choose decorations
- Plan games
- Order cake
- Send invitations

### 2. Pattern Recognition: Finding Similarities
Look for things that repeat or are similar.

**Patterns in Nature:**
- Flower petals often come in 3, 5, or 8
- Snowflakes always have 6 sides
- Zebra stripes, leopard spots

**Patterns in Games:**
- Chess: Each piece moves in a pattern
- Music: Verses and choruses repeat
- Math: 2, 4, 6, 8... (adding 2 each time)

### 3. Abstraction: Focus on What's Important
Ignore unnecessary details, keep the important stuff.

**Drawing a Map to Your House:**
Important: Streets, landmarks, turns
Not Important: Color of houses, types of trees, car models

### 4. Algorithm Design: Step-by-Step Solutions
Create clear instructions to solve the problem.

## Logic Puzzles

### The River Crossing Puzzle
A farmer needs to cross a river with:
- A fox
- A chicken
- A bag of grain

Rules:
- The boat only fits the farmer + 1 item
- If left alone: Fox eats chicken, Chicken eats grain

Can you figure out how to get everything across safely?

The chicken needs special attention...

### The Tower of Hanoi
You have 3 pegs and 3 disks of different sizes.
Rules:
- Move one disk at a time
- Never put a bigger disk on a smaller disk
- Move all disks from peg 1 to peg 3

Start with 3 disks, then try 4, then 5!

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort: The Simple Way
Imagine sorting playing cards from smallest to largest:
1. Compare first two cards
2. If they're in wrong order, swap them
3. Move to next pair
4. Repeat until no more swaps needed

Try it with: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]

### Binary Search: The Smart Way
Finding a word in a dictionary:

**Slow way:** Start at A, check every word
**Fast way:**
1. Open to middle
2. Is your word before or after?
3. Go to middle of that half
4. Repeat until found!

## Code Breaking & Ciphers

### Caesar Cipher
Shift each letter by a certain number:
- A â†’ D (shift of 3)
- B â†’ E
- C â†’ F

Try to decode: "FRPSXWHUV DUH IXQ"
(Hint: shift of 3)

### Create Your Own Code
Make a substitution cipher:
- A = ðŸŒŸ
- B = ðŸŽˆ
- C = ðŸš€
And so on!

## Optimization: Making Things Better

### The Traveling Salesperson Problem
You need to deliver packages to 4 houses and return home. What's the shortest route?

Draw a map and try different paths. This problem gets REALLY hard with lots of stops!

## Debugging Strategies

When something goes wrong:

1. **Read the error message** - It often tells you what's wrong
2. **Check one thing at a time** - Don't change everything at once
3. **Work backwards** - Start from where it broke
4. **Take a break** - Fresh eyes see new things
5. **Ask for help** - Two brains are better than one

## Fun Activities

### 20 Questions: Binary Search Game
- Think of an animal
- Others ask yes/no questions
- Try to guess in 20 questions or less
- Good questions eliminate half the possibilities!

### Human Sorting
- 5 people stand in a line with random numbers (1-10)
- Without talking, arrange yourselves in order
- You can only swap places with the person next to you
- Count how many swaps it takes!

### Pattern Detective
Find the next item in these sequences:
1. 2, 4, 8, 16, ___
2. ðŸ”´ðŸ”µðŸ”´ðŸ”µðŸ”´___
3. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ___

## Real-World Problem Solving

**Problem:** School cafeteria lunch line is too slow

Apply computational thinking:
1. **Decompose:** What parts make it slow?
2. **Patterns:** When is it slowest?
3. **Abstraction:** What's the main bottleneck?
4. **Algorithm:** Design a better system!

## Think About It

- What patterns do you notice in your daily routine?
- How would you explain making a sandwich to an alien who's never seen one?
- What's a problem in your life that could use better organization?
