# Chapter 10: Cybersecurity (Keeping Information Safe)

## Why Security Matters

Imagine if someone could:
- Read all your messages
- Change your game scores
- Use your account to send mean messages
- See your passwords

That's why we need cybersecurity - protecting our digital stuff!

## Passwords: Your Digital Keys

### What Makes a Strong Password?

**Weak Password:** password123 ‚ùå
**Strong Password:** Purpl3Eleph@nt!Danc3s ‚úì

Strong passwords have:
- At least 12 characters
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special symbols (!@#$%)
- No personal information (birthday, pet name)

### Password Tips
- Different password for each account
- Use a passphrase: "MyDogLoves2ChaseBlueBirds!"
- Never share passwords (not even with best friends!)
- Use a password manager (with parent's help)

## Encryption: Secret Codes

Encryption scrambles information so only the right person can read it.

### Simple Encryption Example
**Original:** HELLO
**Encrypted (shift by 1):** IFMMP
**Decrypted:** HELLO

### Modern Encryption
When you see üîí in your browser, it means the website uses encryption:
- Your computer and website share a secret key
- All messages are scrambled with this key
- Only you and the website can unscramble them

## Common Online Threats

### Phishing: Fake Messages
Criminals pretending to be someone else to steal information.

**Warning Signs:**
- Spelling mistakes
- Asks for password
- Threats ("Your account will be deleted!")
- Too good to be true ("You won $1,000,000!")
- Strange email address

### Malware: Bad Software
Programs designed to harm your computer:
- **Virus:** Spreads to other files
- **Trojan Horse:** Pretends to be good software
- **Spyware:** Watches what you do

**Protection:**
- Don't download from unknown sites
- Keep software updated
- Use antivirus software

### Social Engineering: Tricking People
Bad guys trick people into giving information:
- "I'm from tech support, what's your password?"
- "Your mom told me to pick you up, what's your address?"

**Remember:** Real companies NEVER ask for passwords!

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Like having two locks on a door:
1. Something you know (password)
2. Something you have (phone) or are (fingerprint)

Even if someone steals your password, they can't get in without the second factor!

## Privacy: Controlling Your Information

### Digital Footprint
Everything you do online leaves a trace:
- Websites you visit
- Things you search
- Photos you share
- Comments you make

**Think:** Would you be OK with everyone seeing this?

### Privacy Settings
Check privacy settings on:
- Social media
- Games
- Apps

Options usually include:
- Who can see your posts
- Who can message you
- What information apps can access

## Safe Online Behavior

### The THINK Method
Before posting or sending:
- **T**: Is it True?
- **H**: Is it Helpful?
- **I**: Is it Inspiring?
- **N**: Is it Necessary?
- **K**: Is it Kind?

### Personal Information to Keep Private
NEVER share online:
- Full name
- Home address
- School name
- Phone number
- Passwords
- Current location
- When you're home alone

## How Websites Track You

### Cookies: Digital Breadcrumbs
Small files websites save on your computer:
- Remember you're logged in
- Save your preferences
- Track what you look at (for ads)

### Digital Fingerprinting
Websites can identify you by:
- Browser type
- Screen size
- Installed fonts
- Time zone

## Secure Communication

### End-to-End Encryption
Messages are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on recipient's device. Even the company can't read them!

Like sending a letter in a locked box where only the recipient has the key.

## Fun Activity: Encryption Challenge

### Create Your Own Cipher Wheel
1. Make two paper circles (one smaller)
2. Write alphabet around edge of both
3. Pin them together so they rotate
4. Rotate to set your "key"
5. Encrypt messages for friends!

### Password Strength Game
Create passwords and rate them:
- cat ‚Üí Weak (0 points)
- Cat123 ‚Üí Better (3 points)
- MyC@tLik3sFish! ‚Üí Strong (10 points)

## Incident Response: What If Something Goes Wrong?

If you think you've been hacked:
1. Tell a trusted adult immediately
2. Change your password
3. Check what the hacker did
4. Enable 2FA
5. Watch for suspicious activity

## White Hat vs Black Hat Hackers

### Black Hat: The Bad Guys
- Break into systems illegally
- Steal information
- Cause damage

### White Hat: The Good Guys
- Test security (with permission!)
- Find and fix vulnerabilities
- Protect systems

### Bug Bounties
Companies pay white hat hackers to find security problems!

## Security Careers

- Security Analyst
- Ethical Hacker
- Cryptographer
- Security Architect
- Digital Forensics Investigator

## Think About It

- Why might someone want to steal digital information?
- How is digital security like physical security (locks, alarms)?
- What would happen if encryption didn't exist?
