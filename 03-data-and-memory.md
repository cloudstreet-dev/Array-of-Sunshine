# Chapter 3: How Computers Remember Things (Data & Memory)

## Types of Information (Data)

Computers store different types of information:

**Numbers:** 42, 3.14, 1000000
**Words (Text):** "Hello!", "Pizza", your name
**True/False (Boolean):** Yes or No, On or Off
**Pictures:** Made of tiny colored dots called pixels
**Sounds:** Stored as wave patterns
**Videos:** Lots of pictures shown really fast!

## Bits and Bytes: Computer Memory Units

Remember how computers only understand 1s and 0s? Each 1 or 0 is called a **bit**.

- **1 bit** = One yes/no answer
- **8 bits** = 1 **byte** (like one letter)
- **1000 bytes** = 1 **kilobyte** (KB) - a short story
- **1000 KB** = 1 **megabyte** (MB) - a photo
- **1000 MB** = 1 **gigabyte** (GB) - a movie
- **1000 GB** = 1 **terabyte** (TB) - 250,000 photos!

## How Computers Store Different Things

**Text:** Each letter gets a number code
- A = 65
- B = 66
- a = 97
- Space = 32

**Colors:** Mixed from Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)
- Pure Red = (255, 0, 0)
- Pure Blue = (0, 0, 255)
- Purple = (128, 0, 128)
- White = (255, 255, 255)
- Black = (0, 0, 0)

**Images:** A grid of colored dots (pixels)
- More pixels = clearer picture
- Each pixel has an RGB color value

## Variables: Giving Data Names

Programmers use "variables" to store information. It's like giving a box a label:

```
playerScore = 100
playerName = "Alex"
livesLeft = 3
gameOver = False
```

The box (variable) can hold different things at different times!

## Lists and Collections

Sometimes we need to store many related things together:

**Shopping List:**
- Milk
- Eggs
- Bread
- Apples

In programming, we call this an "array" or "list":
```
shoppingList = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Apples"]
```

## Organizing Data (Structures)

We can organize related information together:

**Player Information:**
- Name: "SuperGamer123"
- Score: 9500
- Level: 7
- PowerUps: ["Speed", "Shield", "LaserBeam"]

## Fun Activity: Create a Pixel Picture

On graph paper (or make a grid):
1. Make a 10x10 grid
2. Create a simple picture by coloring squares
3. Write down the "code" for your picture:
   - 0 = White
   - 1 = Black
   - 2 = Red
   - 3 = Blue
   - 4 = Green

Example for a smiley face:
```
0000000000
0011001100
0011001100
0000000000
0100000100
0100000100
0011111100
0000000000
```

## Memory Game

Play this memory game to understand computer storage:
1. Look at 5 objects for 30 seconds
2. Close your eyes
3. Try to remember all 5 objects
4. Add 2 more objects and repeat

Computers can remember thousands of things perfectly - that's their superpower!

## Think About It

- How many photos do you think fit on your device?
- Why do games take up so much storage space?
- If you could only use numbers, how would you store your name?
