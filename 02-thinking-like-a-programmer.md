# Chapter 2: Thinking Like a Programmer (Algorithms & Logic)

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is just a fancy word for "step-by-step instructions." You use algorithms every day!

Examples of everyday algorithms:
- Making a peanut butter sandwich
- Brushing your teeth
- Getting ready for school
- Playing a board game (the rules are the algorithm!)

## Breaking Down Problems

Programmers are really good at taking BIG problems and breaking them into SMALL steps. This is called "decomposition" (like decomposing, but for problems, not leaves!).

**Big Problem:** Clean your room
**Small Steps:**
1. Pick up all clothes
2. Put dirty clothes in hamper
3. Hang clean clothes in closet
4. Make bed
5. Put toys in toy box
6. Put books on shelf

## The Power of Order (Sequence)

The ORDER of steps matters! Try this:

**Algorithm 1: Getting Dressed**
1. Put on socks
2. Put on shoes
3. Put on pants

**Algorithm 2: Getting Dressed (Better!)**
1. Put on socks
2. Put on pants
3. Put on shoes

See the problem with Algorithm 1? ðŸ˜„

## Making Decisions (If-Then Statements)

Computers make decisions using IF-THEN logic:

**IF** it's raining, **THEN** take an umbrella
**IF** homework is done, **THEN** you can play games
**IF** the light is red, **THEN** stop

In programming, we call these "conditional statements."

## Loops: Doing Things Over and Over

Instead of writing the same instruction many times, we use loops!

**Without a loop:**
1. Eat one spoonful of cereal
2. Eat one spoonful of cereal
3. Eat one spoonful of cereal
4. Eat one spoonful of cereal
(... 20 more times!)

**With a loop:**
1. REPEAT 24 times: Eat one spoonful of cereal

Much easier, right?

## Debugging: Finding and Fixing Mistakes

When programmers make mistakes (and they make LOTS of them!), it's called a "bug." Finding and fixing bugs is called "debugging."

**Buggy Algorithm: Making a Sandwich**
1. Get two slices of bread
2. Eat the sandwich
3. Put peanut butter on one slice
4. Put jelly on the other slice
5. Put the slices together

Can you spot the bug? (Hint: Check the order!)

## Fun Activity: Program Your Parent!

Write an algorithm to make your parent do something simple, like making you a snack:

1. Write EXACT steps (remember, they're a computer - be specific!)
2. Have them follow your instructions EXACTLY
3. Watch what happens!
4. Debug your algorithm if something goes wrong

Example starts:
1. Walk to the kitchen
2. Open the refrigerator door
3. Look for apples
4. IF there are apples, take one out...

## Logic Puzzles

Try this: Three friends (Ali, Beth, and Carlos) have three different pets (dog, cat, bird).
- Ali is allergic to fur
- Beth's pet can fly
- Carlos doesn't have the cat

Who has which pet? (Use logic to figure it out!)

## Think About It

- What algorithms do you use without thinking about them?
- Why is being specific important when giving instructions?
- Can you think of a time when the order of steps really matters?
